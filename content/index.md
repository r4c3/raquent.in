I'm Race, a CS undergrad from the US interested in programming languages and software design. I work on developer tools, namely [[https://github.com/skrusenti/skru|Skru]], [[https://github.com/raquentin/haskode|Haskode]], and soon some things at Credit Karma.


This site hosts opinionated writeups and personal notes primarily on computer science and software engineering.

- An unsorted list of [[posts/my-favorite-quotes-in-programming|my favorite quotes in programming]].
