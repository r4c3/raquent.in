I'm Race, a sysarch/theory CS undergrad at Georgia Tech interested in programming languages, algorithms, and software design. I mostly work on libraries and devtools.

This site hosts opinionated writeups and personal notes primarily on computer science and software engineering. 

You may want to visit:
- Any one of my [[posts]].
- A list of my personal [[notes]] on topics like dsa and compilers.
- An unsorted list of [[posts/my-favorite-quotes-in-programming|my favorite quotes in programming]].
- [[posts/the-booklist|The Booklist]], an enumeration of books that I have read, am reading, and intend to read.

Any questions contact race@raquent.in.
