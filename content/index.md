My name is Race Williams. I'm a third-year CS undergrad at Georgia Tech. I like computer architecture, programming languages, spoken languages, and poker.

You may find interest in:
  - my blog-like [[posts]],
  - some [[notes]] on math and computer science,
  - or my [[posts/the-booklist|reading list]].

Current work pq:
  - [a domain-specific language backended by cURL](https://github.com/raquentin/raquest),
  - my aforementioned reading list,
  - [algorithmic trading on FPGAs with Haskell](https://github.com/raquentin/punt-engine),
  - [the Gleam language and related libraries](https://github.com/raquentin/gripe),
  - [изучением русского языка](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7155095488885624832/),
  - my coursework,
  - Texas Hold'em cash strategy,
  - and an unimpressive [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/raquentin) elo push.
