I'm Race, a sysarch/theory CS undergrad at Georgia Tech interested in programming languages, algorithms, and software design. I mostly work on libraries and devtools.

This site hosts writeups and personal notes on computer science and software engineering. 

The main things on here are my [[posts]], [[notes]] on topics like dsa and compilers, a list of [[posts/my-favorite-quotes-in-programming|my favorite quotes in programming]], and another of [[posts/the-booklist|some books I'm reading]].

Any questions contact race@raquent.in.
